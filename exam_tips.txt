Exam Tips 

Dear students as we have a mid-term exam for theory subjects next week.
I wanted to share some tips for the exam that might help in taking good grades to you and me as well.

1) Relax.
2) Solve and understand all assignments.
3) Solve and understand all previous exams.
4) For programming subjects run and understand all codes.
5) Go through all lecture slides and notes.
6) There are some questions in exams that are tough, do not leave them empty, at least apply your concepts to take some marks.
7) Pray for each other's success, as prayers matter a lot. Phone to parents for Duas.
8) Always take care of your health as well. (sleep and eat well)

Wishing you success in your exams. May your preparation bring fantastic outcomes!
